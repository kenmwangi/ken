# Personal Blog

I plan to handle this blog as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) where I want to start working with the least features I need for a blog and iterate as move foward.
I will try to write about my full stack development journey, open-source contributions and my thoughts.

## Features

- Content generation - using ContentLayer instead of Mdx files
- Nextauth authentication and authorization.
